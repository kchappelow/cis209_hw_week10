Locate the largest element

Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array.

```
public static int[] locateLargest(double[][] a)
```

The return value is a one-dimensional array that contains two elements. These two elements indicate
the row and column indices of the largest element in the two-dimensional array. 

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location of 
the largest element in the array.

Here is a sample run:

```
Enter the number of rows and columns of the array: 3 4
Enter the array:
23.5 35 2 10
4.5 3 45 3.5
35 44 5.5 9.6
The location of the largest element is at (1, 2)
```

Task #1: Write the program and method with appropriate comments.

Task #2: Run the program to make sure it works.

Task #3: Submit the homework using git.
